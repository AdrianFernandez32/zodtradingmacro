### Building steps
1. Place the iron trapdoor and surround it with packed ice. (You can replace the Stone Bricks block with more Packed Ice or any other type of block, but it may not work as well.)

2. Place stone blocks around the ice and place the villager on the iron trapdoor. Make sure to enclose the villager with four blocks.

3. Dig one block down in front of the structure, place a slab, and close it off with two more blocks.

Done!
If you‚Äôd like, you can build additional steps, such as walls around the villager.
## How to use macro
### Gameplay positioning
1. Align yourself with the middle of the block beneath you.
![2024-11-01_12 23 35](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc2cf0cf-063d-4d18-bfc9-63b1297ce719)
2. Align your cursor with the last pixel of the block in front of you, but make sure it doesn‚Äôt touch the iron trapdoor.
![2024-11-01_12 23 42](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08c59481-190b-4566-b956-83c6d321f776)
3. Place the lectern and wait until the villager gets the job.
![2024-11-01_12 23 54](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1feb43d2-cb98-4159-92a8-435af6e1dc67)
4. Make sure not to move your mouse; you can use `Alt + Tab` to switch to the .exe file.
### Start macro
When you execute the .exe file, this UI will pop up:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a319bbb5-278e-4393-9806-2c63702fb789)
- Here, you can choose which type of axe and enchantments you will be using.
- "Stop key" is the key you want to assign to stop the loop.
- "Delay" is the amount of time you want to view the enchantments. Make sure to choose the right time so you don‚Äôt miss a good enchantment.

Now you can start the macro. When it starts, you'll have 3 seconds to switch to the Minecraft window. Make sure to use `Alt + Tab`.
## Important
When stopping the macro, it must complete the loop to stop fully. So DON'T PANIC ‚Äì once you find the perfect enchantment, press the stop key and wait until the macro closes the villager's menu.

## Notes
### Next steps
I'll be working on making this automatic, which will allow you to stay idle and choose which enchantments you want, stopping the loop once it finds them. Everything will remain in vanilla.
